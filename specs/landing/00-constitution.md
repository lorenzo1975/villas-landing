# Engineering Constitution — Villas.co.th Landing

**Purpose**: Deliver a fast, elegant, trustworthy landing page that communicates the Villas.co.th vision and captures leads before full marketplace launch.

## Non‑Negotiables
- **Performance**: Lighthouse 95+ on Performance and Best Practices.
- **A11y**: WCAG AA basics (semantic HTML, labels, focus states).
- **Brand**: Calm, premium, Thailand villa vibe; minimalism > clutter.
- **Copy first**: Content drives layout. No lorem ipsum in final build.
- **Animation restraint**: Motion enhances comprehension, not distracts.
- **DX**: Clean components (shadcn/ui), typed, zero unused deps.
- **International**: EN ready with i18n hooks for TH/中文 later.

## UX Guardrails
- Clear primary CTA (Join Waitlist / List Your Villa).
- Secondary CTA (Read the Vision / Partner With Us).
- Above-the-fold value props + credibility (badges/press logos).
- Social proof (logos/testimonials) and safety (escrow/legal notes).
- Footer with legal, contact, socials, lightweight sitemap.

## Delivery Rules
- Feature flags for sections; progressive enhancement favored.
- Copy and content live in a simple content layer (MDX/JSON) for easy edits.
- Analytics and consent baked in (no blocking trackers).
