# Spec Kit Slash‑Command Script — Use Inside Your Coding Agent

/constitution Refine our engineering constitution to focus on an elegant premium landing for Villas.co.th. Keep: performance, a11y, brand, animation restraint.

/specify Create a single‑page landing that communicates Villas.co.th’s mission, trust & safety, and invites users to join early. Two funnels: Waitlist (buyers/renters) and Partner (owners/agents/developers/lawyers). Sections: Hero, How It Works, Who It’s For, Trust & Safety, Coming Soon, Join Early, About/Press, Footer.

/plan Use Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion. Generate component list, file structure, and routing per `02-plan.md`. Ensure typesafe forms with zod + react-hook-form. Include instructions for shadcn components to generate.

/tasks Break down the plan into step-by-step tasks that fit a fresh create-next-app project. Output checkboxes and exact shell commands, with notes for client components for motion.

/implement Implement the tasks and generate code for each section. Follow the content model from `/content` JSON and wire forms to a placeholder action. Keep animation subtle and accessible.

/validate Run a heuristic checklist: performance, a11y, content accuracy, role clarity, analytics present (placeholder), legal pages included, OG metadata set.
